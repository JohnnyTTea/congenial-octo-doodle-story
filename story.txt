Once upon a time there was a young man who was looking for an adventure.
Unfortunately, he lived in a small town, with happy people, in the middle
of nowhere. There was no adventure to be found! No dragons to slay, treasure
to loot, or princesses to save. This young man, who went by the name of Urslap,
spent years pining for some supernatural event to fly through his town so he
could have an adventure, but one never came. So he kept to his boring job,
and his boring house, in his boring town. But one day, that all changed

Urslap was on his way back from work one day, driving in his car home, when
all of a sudden, he saw what looked to be an accident in front of him by
100 yards or so. He slowed his car, put on his hazards, and pulled over behind
the accident. There was a large semi-truck flipped over in the ditch on the
side of the road. Quickly, Urslap made his way to the front of the truck,
but there was no driver.

Weirdly, Urslap did't seem to be terrified or upset by the scene, but his inner
excitement arose secretly. Quickly, he scanned through the driver's seat. "Blood
presents, seat belt's out. The car was hit by something" He took a glance around.
"No animal bodies, but it's the middle of the road, there's no other possibilities,
unless the victim was attacked." Almost immediately, Urslap looked at the seatbelt
slot. It's opened, but not by the victim, otherwise blood would leave fingerprint
on the button. The attacker had cleaned part of the evidence, but why not all?
"Shit!" With a fierce hit from behind, Urslap realized the crime was still in process.
